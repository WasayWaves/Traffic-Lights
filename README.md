# Traffic-Lights
To complete the main function for the embedded system project, we will need to write code for the following tasks:

Initialize the GPIO pins to control the LEDs and read input from the switches.
Control the LEDs and read input from the switches in a loop.
Wait for a short period of time between each loop iteration
